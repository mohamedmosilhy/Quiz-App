Certainly! I've added a "Demo" section and a "Technologies Used" section to your README file to provide information about how to see the project in action and the technologies used to build it.

Here's the updated README file:

# Quiz Application

## Overview

This is a simple quiz application that allows users to take a quiz and receive their results at the end. The application fetches quiz questions from a JSON file, presents them to the user one at a time, and tracks their progress and scores.

## Features

- Displays the category and total number of questions.
- Presents questions one by one with multiple-choice answers.
- Tracks the user's progress with bullet indicators.
- Implements a countdown timer for each question.
- Allows users to submit answers and see their results at the end.

## Demo

You can try out the quiz application by following these steps:

1. Visit the [Quiz Application Demo](https://your-demo-link.com) to access the live version of the quiz.

2. You will see the category, the total number of questions, and a question with multiple-choice answers.

3. Select an answer and click the "Submit Answer" button.

4. The application will advance to the next question, and the timer will reset.

5. Repeat the process for all questions.

6. At the end of the quiz, the application will display your results, including the level (good or bad), the number of correct answers, and the total number of questions.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the quiz application's user interface.

- **main.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for fetching questions, rendering questions and answers, managing the timer, and calculating results.

- **styles.css**: The CSS file that styles the appearance of the quiz application.

- **data.json**: A JSON file containing the quiz questions and their corresponding answers.

## Technologies Used

This project makes use of the following technologies and tools:

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web page.

- **CSS**: Used for styling the user interface.

- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing the quiz logic, timer, and interaction.

- **JSON**: Used for storing quiz questions and answers.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quiz-application.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to run the quiz application.

3. Customize the quiz questions by modifying the `data.json` file. Each question should have a title and four possible answers, with one designated as the correct answer.
